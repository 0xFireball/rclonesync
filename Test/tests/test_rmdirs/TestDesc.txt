test_rmdirs

Test --remove-empty-directories logic.  Without this switch the subdir should not be deleted when empty,
and deleted with the switch.

After the initial setup sync:
1) Delete Path1 subdir/file20.txt
2) rclonesync without --remove-empty-directories
3) Confirm subdir exists on both paths
4) rclonesync with --remove-empty-directories
5) Confirm subdir has been removed on both paths
