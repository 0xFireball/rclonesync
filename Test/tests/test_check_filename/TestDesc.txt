test_check_filename

Test --check-filename .chk_file.  test_check_access is a more complete test of the check-access logic.

1) First, see that --check-access passes with the initial setup
2) Delete the remote subdir .chk_file, run sync, will fail critical
3) Put the remote subdir .chk_file back, run --first-sync
4) Run sync with --check-access.  Should pass.
