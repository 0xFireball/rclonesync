test_filtersfile_checks

Tests rclonesync's --filters-file MD5 hash checks logic

Note that this test checks for rclonesync's handling of filters files, not an extensive test of rclone's filter capability.
The effectiveness of the filters is not tested.

Sequence:
	Run with --filters-file but with no MD5	Should CRITICAL abort
	Run without --filtersfile 				Should be blocked due to prior CRITICAL abort
	Run with --filters-file and --first-sync
	Run with --filters-file alone.  		Should run
	push changed filtersfile
	Run with --filters-file alone.  		Should CRITICAL abort
